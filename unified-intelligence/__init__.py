"""
Unified Financial Intelligence System
======================================

This module bridges Java transaction processing and Python LLM capabilities
into a single cohesive system where:

1. Data flows bidirectionally (not just API calls)
2. Shared business logic spans both languages
3. Single source of truth for all financial intelligence

NOT just "Java calls Python API" - this is deep integration.
